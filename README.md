# League of Legends Server

Server for: https://github.com/tomyreyes/LoL-stats-app
## Usage:

Clone repository

```
npm install
```

``` 
node server.js
```

## Note:

I am using dotenv to hide the API Key I use, as requested by the LoL API. 
Once you clone the repository you need to make an .env file locally and use your own registered API Key.
